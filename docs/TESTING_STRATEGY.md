# Authentication & Authorization Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the authentication and role management system implemented in Social Autopilot. The testing approach covers unit tests, integration tests, security tests, and user acceptance tests.

## Test Coverage Summary

### 1. Unit Tests
**Location**: `__tests__/auth/auth-utils.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Password hashing and verification
- Session token generation and validation
- Permission system operations
- Role checking and validation
- Security edge cases

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Password hashing creates unique, secure hashes
- ✅ Password verification correctly validates credentials
- ✅ Session tokens include proper user data and expiration
- ✅ Permission matrix correctly maps roles to permissions
- ✅ Role hierarchy is properly enforced (VIEWER ⊂ EDITOR ⊂ ADMIN)
- ✅ Null/undefined handling prevents crashes
- ✅ SQL injection attempts are safely handled

**Total Test Cases**: 40+

### 2. API Route Integration Tests
**Location**: `__tests__/auth/api-routes.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- User registration with validation
- User login with session management
- Logout with proper cleanup
- Session management and refresh
- Security features (CSRF, rate limiting, input sanitization)

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Successful user registration creates profile and session
- ✅ Login with valid credentials returns JWT token
- ✅ Invalid credentials are properly rejected
- ✅ Session cookies are set with secure flags (HttpOnly, SameSite)
- ✅ Logout clears cookies and deactivates sessions
- ✅ Token refresh maintains user authentication
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- ✅ CSRF protection is enforced

**Total Test Cases**: 50+

### 3. Permission Middleware Tests
**Location**: `__tests__/auth/permission-middleware.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
- Authentication middleware
- Permission-based access control
- Role-based access control
- Middleware chaining
- Performance optimization

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Valid tokens grant access
- ✅ Invalid/missing tokens deny access
- ✅ ADMIN users have all permissions
- ✅ EDITOR users have limited permissions
- ✅ VIEWER users have read-only access
- ✅ Middleware efficiently validates multiple requests
- ✅ Permission checks are properly cached
- ✅ Malformed cookies are handled gracefully

**Total Test Cases**: 35+

### 4. React Hook Tests
**Location**: `__tests__/auth/use-auth.test.tsx`

**Coverage**:
- Authentication state management
- Login/logout operations
- User registration
- Permission checking hooks
- Session refresh logic
- Error handling

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Hook initializes with correct state
- ✅ Login updates auth state
- ✅ Logout clears user data
- ✅ Registration creates new user
- ✅ Permission checks work at runtime
- ✅ 401 errors trigger automatic token refresh
- ✅ Network errors are properly handled
- ✅ Hook context requirement is enforced

**Total Test Cases**: 25+

## Security Testing

### Implemented Security Tests

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Password strength validation
   - Brute force prevention (rate limiting)
   - Session hijacking prevention (secure cookies)
   - Token expiration and refresh

2. **Authorization Security**
   - Role-based access control enforcement
   - Permission bypass attempt prevention
   - Privilege escalation prevention
   - Resource-level authorization

3. **Input Validation**
   - XSS prevention through input sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Email validation
   - Password complexity requirements

4. **Session Management**
   - Secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   - Session expiration and timeout
   - Multi-device session management
   - Session revocation on logout

### Security Test Matrix

| Test Category | Coverage | Status |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Password Security | Hashing, strength, validation | ✅ Complete |
| Session Security | Token management, expiration | ✅ Complete |
| Permission Enforcement | RBAC, granular permissions | ✅ Complete |
| Input Validation | Sanitization, XSS prevention | ✅ Complete |
| Rate Limiting | Brute force prevention | ✅ Complete |
| CSRF Protection | Token validation | ✅ Complete |

## Test Execution

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run auth tests only
npm test -- __tests__/auth

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# CI mode (no watch, with coverage)
npm run test:ci
```

### Expected Results

- **Test Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Code Coverage**: >80%
  - Branches: >70%
  - Functions: >70%
  - Lines: >70%
  - Statements: >70%

### Test Performance

- **Average Execution Time**: <10 seconds for full suite

   - Deploy test results
   - Archive coverage reports

### Test Automation

- **Trigger**: Every push, PR, and scheduled nightly
- **Environment**: Node 20+
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled for faster results

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

### UAT Scenarios

1. **User Registration**
   - ✅ New user can register with valid credentials
   - ✅ Registration fails with weak password
   - ✅ Registration fails with duplicate email
   - ✅ User profile is created automatically

2. **User Login**
   - ✅ User can login with correct credentials
   - ✅ Login fails with incorrect credentials
   - ✅ Session persists across page refreshes
   - ✅ User is redirected to dashboard after login

3. **Permission Management**
