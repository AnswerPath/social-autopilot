Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.\n<info added on 2025-08-28T23:35:33.127Z>\nCreate an Apify-based integration service that replaces the X API OAuth flow. Implement authentication using Apify API keys instead of OAuth tokens. Configure and utilize Apify actors for core X functionality including posting content, retrieving mentions, and collecting analytics data. Store the Apify API key securely in an encrypted database field. Implement proper error handling for Apify actor execution failures and API limitations. Create wrapper functions that abstract the Apify actor calls to maintain consistent interfaces with the rest of the application.\n</info added on 2025-08-28T23:35:33.127Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-28T23:44:09.293Z>\nImplementation completed for the Apify integration service. The ApifyService class has been created with comprehensive methods for social media operations including posting, mentions retrieval, analytics collection, and profile management. A dedicated Apify storage module handles secure credential management with encryption. API routes have been implemented for credential CRUD operations and connection testing functionality. The frontend includes a React component for Apify settings management with user-friendly configuration options. Comprehensive documentation has been created covering the integration architecture, usage examples, and troubleshooting guides. This implementation successfully replaces the originally planned OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with a simpler Apify API key authentication system while maintaining all required functionality through Apify actors.\n</info added on 2025-08-28T23:44:09.293Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-31T20:49:23.917Z>\nImplement a hybrid integration approach combining Apify for scraping/reading operations and the official X API for posting functionality. Configure the system to use the specialized Apify actor 'watcher.data/search-x-by-keywords' for all X data scraping operations. Extend the existing ApifyService class to support this hybrid model, maintaining the Apify integration for data retrieval while adding official X API client functionality for posting operations. Modify the credential management system to securely store both Apify API keys and X API credentials (API key, API key secret, access token, and access token secret) in encrypted database fields. Update the settings management interface to include input fields for both Apify and X API credentials with appropriate validation. Implement proper error handling to gracefully manage failures from either integration path and provide clear feedback to users about which system encountered issues.\n</info added on 2025-08-31T20:49:23.917Z>",
