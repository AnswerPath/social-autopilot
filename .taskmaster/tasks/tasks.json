A dedicated Apify storage module handles secure credential management with encryption. API routes have been implemented for credential CRUD operations and connection testing functionality. The frontend includes a React component for Apify settings management with user-friendly configuration options. Comprehensive documentation has been created covering the integration architecture, usage examples, and troubleshooting guides. This implementation successfully replaces the originally planned OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with a simpler Apify API key authentication system while maintaining all required functionality through Apify actors.\n</info added on 2025-08-28T23:44:09.293Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-31T20:49:23.917Z>\nImplement a hybrid integration approach combining Apify for scraping/reading operations and the official X API for posting functionality. Configure the system to use the specialized Apify actor 'watcher.data/search-x-by-keywords' for all X data scraping operations. Extend the existing ApifyService class to support this hybrid model, maintaining the Apify integration for data retrieval while adding official X API client functionality for posting operations. Modify the credential management system to securely store both Apify API keys and X API credentials (API key, API key secret, access token, and access token secret) in encrypted database fields. Update the settings management interface to include input fields for both Apify and X API credentials with appropriate validation.
