		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "User Authentication and Role Management",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of user authentication and role management into subtasks covering: authentication system setup (secure password hashing, session/token management), role-based access control (admin, editor, viewer), granular permission management (post creation, scheduling, approval, analytics), user profile management (account settings), activity logging for auditability, team collaboration features (user assignment, visibility controls), and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, security, UAT, audit log verification).",
			"reasoning": "This task encompasses multiple high-complexity domains: secure authentication, fine-grained RBAC, permission management, user profile and settings, audit logging, and team collaboration features. Each area requires careful design, security best practices, and robust testing. The breadth and depth of requirements, combined with the need for extensibility and compliance, make this a highly complex, multi-faceted system that should be decomposed into at least 10 focused subtasks for effective implementation and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "System Monitoring and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: application performance monitoring setup, error tracking and alerting, structured logging implementation, error handling strategy (user messaging, retry logic), admin dashboard for system health, automated recovery procedures, feature flag integration, and comprehensive testing (chaos, log analysis, alert validation, recovery, performance under load, UX during errors).",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive monitoring and error handling require integration of multiple tools and patterns (APM, logging, alerting, dashboards, recovery automation, feature flags). Each component must be robust, observable, and testable under failure scenarios. The need for reliability, real-time alerting, and automated recovery increases complexity, warranting decomposition into at least 8 specialized subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Post Scheduling and Calendar View",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose this task into subtasks for: scheduling system with timezone and conflict detection, interactive calendar view (drag-and-drop), bulk scheduling interface, CSV import/export, scheduling queue and job processing, visual status indicators, rescheduling/cancellation logic, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, performance, CSV validation, end-to-end flow).",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex UI (calendar, drag-and-drop), backend scheduling logic (timezone, conflict detection, job queues), bulk operations, and data import/export. Ensuring reliability, usability, and performance across these areas requires modularization into at least 8 subtasks, each addressing a distinct technical or UX challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "X API Integration and OAuth Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for: OAuth 2.0 flow implementation, token management (secure storage, refresh), API rate limit handling, error handling for API downtime, service layer for X API operations (post, schedule, mentions, analytics), GDPR/CCPA compliance, security audit, unit/integration testing, token refresh and error scenario validation, and load/rate limit testing.",
			"reasoning": "API integration with secure OAuth, token lifecycle management, rate limiting, and compliance introduces significant complexity, especially with external dependencies and security requirements. The task is already decomposed into 10 subtasks, which is appropriate given the number of distinct concerns and the need for thorough testing and compliance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Post Composer and Media Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: rich text editor with X-specific formatting, media upload/validation (images, videos), character counter and validation, draft saving with auto-save, post preview, emoji picker and hashtag suggestions, responsive/mobile design, and comprehensive testing (validation, media, cross-browser, accessibility, performance).",
			"reasoning": "Building a feature-rich post composer with media management, validation, and responsive design involves complex UI/UX, file handling, and real-time feedback. Each feature (editor, media, validation, preview, suggestions, responsiveness) is substantial and should be implemented as a separate subtask for maintainability and testability."
